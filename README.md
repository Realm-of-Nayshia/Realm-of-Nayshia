# Realm of Nayshia
This is the core plugin behind the Realm of Nayshia Minecraft server. 

This plugin completely overhauls the vanilla stat systems and introduces 22 new player stats and over 30 new item stats. This plugin creates custom items with cooldown and stamina abilities, custom consumables with different effects, custom armor with more special effects, equipment bonuses, and unique recipes for all these items. On top of the numerous item and stat changes, the plugin uses the Citizens API to apply all these changes to Citizens NPCs and much more. This plugin implements a new XP-based leveling system, NPC quests, custom drops, and introduces over 20 new commands to the game. This plugin is directly tailored for the Realm of Nayshia Minecraft server and will not work standalone.
